  <h4>Hi! My name is Leaf Tohru and I spend 24/7 either making youtube videos, playing roblox, or watching anime!<br>My dream was always to be a popular Youtuber! Well... I am like Ash Ketchum from Pokemon. He always<br>wanted to be a Pokemon master, but you that Ash never going to be one.<br>That's me. I want to be a famous Youtuber but I know I am never going to be one. <br> So I can throw the idea of streaming anime on youtube away. <br> Anyways, enough about me, and on to anime.</h4>

    <h2> What is anime? <h2>
      <article class="">
        <h6> Anime is a type of animated movie. <br> If you are a teenager, and want to watch a cartoon that isn't too "Little kid" fo you then anime is perfect! <br>  There are animes for kids like Pokemon, Robo-Tech, and Super Book. <br> There are also animes for teens like Kaichu wa Maid Sama!, Fruits Basket, and Lull in <br> the Sea. Finally, there are 18+ animes like Gleipnir, Hagani, Sakurasou pet no Kanjo,<br>  and Plunderer. Anime is also a genra, not a movie. Anime can be both a movie <br> or a series. I, personally, perfer the anime series more than the movie. But if you watch<br> anime just be prepared to see some really really really really really weird content. </h6>
